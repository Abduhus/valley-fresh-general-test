# Deployment Note

This file is added to force a new deployment and bypass any caching issues with the Railway build process.

Fixes applied:
1. Updated package.json to use `npx tsc` instead of `tsc` directly
2. Updated railway.json to install TypeScript globally during build
3. Using npx ensures proper execution of TypeScript compiler in CI/CD environments
